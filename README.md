Smart Ambulance Traffic Clearance System 🚑🚦

1. Problem Statement  
Ambulances are often delayed due to heavy traffic and unmanaged signals, leading to life-threatening situations for patients. There is a critical need for a system that ensures ambulances can reach hospitals on time without being obstructed by traffic congestion.


2. Proposed Solution  
This project introduces a **software-based Smart Traffic Light Management System** that:
- Detects when an ambulance is approaching an intersection.
- Automatically turns traffic lights green for the ambulance route.
- Notifies traffic authorities to clear the path.
- Alerts hospitals about the ambulance’s arrival in advance.  

Unlike hardware-based models, this project is designed as a **software prototype**, making it easier to simulate, test, and demonstrate.


3. Stakeholders & Their Roles  

🚑 Ambulance Driver  
- Shares ambulance route and hospital destination.  
- Optionally inputs patient condition for hospital preparation.  

🖥️ System/Application  
- Identifies ambulance route.  
- Controls simulated traffic lights (green/red).  
- Notifies hospitals and traffic police.  

👮 Traffic Authorities  
- Receive alerts about ambulance routes.  
- Clear congested junctions or provide alternate paths.  

🏥 Hospitals  
- Get notified in advance.  
- Prepare beds/doctors based on ambulance input.  


4. User Stories  
1. Ambulance driver selects hospital and route in the system.  
2. System turns green signals ON along ambulance route.  
3. Traffic police receive alerts to manage heavy traffic.  
4. Hospitals prepare emergency facilities in advance.  
5. System reduces patient risk by minimizing travel delays.  

5. Technologies Used  
- Frontend & Backend:** Python (Flask), HTML, CSS  
- Simulation & Test Data:** Excel (test cases), diagrams, mockups  
- **Optional Future Add-ons:** GPS APIs, mobile application, live traffic signal integration
